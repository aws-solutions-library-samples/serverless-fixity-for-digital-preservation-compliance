The project is double licensed, being [WTF2](./LICENSE) the master license and
[MIT](./LICENSE2) the alternative license.
The reason to have two licenses is that some entities refuse to use the master
license (WTF2) due to
bad language. If that's also your case, you can choose the alternative license.
